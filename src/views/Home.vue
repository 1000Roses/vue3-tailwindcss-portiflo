                            I love math, something is abtract stuff. And like almost boys, before i took a lot of time to play game with my friend, one of the best
                            memory that never forget. So that, with the reason, when i was in second and high school, i wished someday i will be the game maker. <br>
                            But, alway is but. I dont know how to make game right now, this is so suck to me, need to collaborate with many people having same passion, qualified and character. <br>
                            Every path make every single diffent target. From Now, <br>
